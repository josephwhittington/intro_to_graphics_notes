## Lecture 2

## Helpful tips
- Use assertions


## Line forulas

### Naive Line(Y = MX + B)
- M = (y2-y1) / (x2 - x1)
- B = Y-intercept
- Replace the slope in the formula and use a point for the x and y values then solve for B
    - B = Y - MX
- Helps if you compute the run and the rise separately
    -   If the run is 0 then it's a vertical line
    -   If the rise if 0 then we have a horizontal line and we can memcopy like a motherfucker

### General Line equation (Ax + By + C = 0)

## Disrance Formula
- D = sqrt((x2-x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2);

## Vector Length
- L = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
